            Why Both Parents Matter: The Science Behind Shared Parenting
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-[#718096]">
            Decades of research consistently demonstrate the profound benefits of maintaining strong relationships with both parents after separation.

            Family courts across the United States increasingly recognize that children thrive when they maintain meaningful relationships with both parents. Extensive research published in peer-reviewed journals demonstrates that shared parenting arrangements lead to better outcomes across virtually every measured dimension of child wellbeing.

            Academic Research on Shared Parenting Benefits
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            A comprehensive meta-analysis published in the Journal of Family Psychology (Fabricius & Suh, 2017) examined over 50 studies involving more than 200,000 children. The findings were clear: children in shared parenting arrangements demonstrated significantly better psychological adjustment, stronger academic performance, and healthier relationships with both parents compared to children in sole custody arrangements.

          <p>
            Research from the American Psychological Association indicates that children benefit most when they spend substantial time with each parent—typically at least 35% of the time with each. Studies show these children exhibit fewer behavioral problems, lower rates of depression and anxiety, and stronger self-esteem than children who see one parent infrequently.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr. Edward Kruk, a professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Social Work, has documented extensively how children in shared parenting arrangements maintain stronger bonds with both parents well into adulthood. His research, published in multiple peer-reviewed journals, demonstrates that equal parenting time reduces parental conflict, increases father involvement, and leads to better co-parenting relationships over time.

            Long-Term Outcomes and Child Development
          </h3>

          <p>
            Longitudinal studies tracking children into adulthood reveal compelling evidence. Research published in Psychology, Public Policy, and Law found that young adults who experienced shared parenting during childhood reported significantly closer relationships with both parents, higher life satisfaction, and better mental health outcomes compared to those raised primarily by one parent.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Swedish National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Young People, which followed thousands of families over decades, found that teenagers in shared custody arrangements reported better relationships with both parents, felt more secure financially, and experienced less stress than their peers in sole custody situations. These effects persisted regardless of socioeconomic status or parental conflict levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            Academic institutions including Stanford University and Arizona State University have published research showing that children in shared parenting arrangements perform better academically, with higher graduation rates and greater college attendance. They also demonstrate stronger social skills, better emotional regulation, and lower rates of substance abuse during adolescence.
